The code is using the Express framework and the PayPal SDK to build a simple web application to pay via PayPal. Here is a partial explanation of the code:

1. Import necessary modules:

- `express`: A web framework to build applications.
- `paypal-rest-sdk`: PayPal SDK to interact with the PayPal API.
- `dotenv`: A module to read environment variables from the `.env` file.

2. Configure PayPal SDK:

- Set the mode to 'sandbox' (testing environment).
- Use the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` from the environment variables to authenticate with PayPal.

3. Create an Express application:

- Initialize an Express application object.
- Define a GET route for the root ('/') that sends the `index.html` file.
- Define a POST route for '/pay' to handle PayPal payment requests.

4. Handle PayPal payment requests:

- Create a `create_payment_json` object representing the payment information.
- Send a payment creation request using the `paypal.payment.create` method.
- If there is an error, throw the error. Otherwise, redirect the user to the PayPal approval URL.

5. Handle the response from PayPal after the user confirms the payment:

- The '/success' page is called after the user successfully confirms the payment on PayPal.
- This page retrieves the `PayerID` and `paymentId` from the query and uses them to confirm the payment.
- Create an `execute_payment_json` object representing the payment execution request.
- Send an execute payment request using the `paypal.payment.execute` method.
- If there is an error, log the error response and throw the error. Otherwise, send a response of "Success" to the user.

6. Handle payment cancellation:

- The '/cancel' page is called when the user cancels the payment on PayPal.
- Return a response of "Cancelled".

8. Start the server:

- Define the `PORT` for the server as 3000 or the value from the environment variable.
- Start listening for connections on the specified `PORT`.
- Print a message indicating that the server has started and the port it's listening on.
